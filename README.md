# Arma language support in Atom

This packages adds syntax highlighting and auto-completions for SQF files in Atom, including functions and macros from the [CBA](http://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3/) and [ACE3](http://github.com/acemod/ACE3/) projects. This package is maintained and developed by the [ACE3](http://ace3mod.com/) development team and the Arma community effort.

Support for the following file types used by the Real Virtuality engine has been added:
- sqf
- sqe
- sqm
- cpp
- hpp
- ext
- cfg

## Features

### Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting for all functions and script commands by Bohemia Interactive is supported. Next to that, functions and macros from CBA and ACE3 projects are also supported.

### Autocomplete

With a goal of faster development in SQF, auto-completion for all BIS functions and script commands, as well as CBA and ACE3 functions and macros, is supported. All autocomplete assets also have a type, description and URL to their documentation.

> CBA and ACE3 commands are optional, but enabled by default.

### Snippets

Quick development also requires writing a lot of different blocks or combinations of code. A handful of useful snippets ranging from BIS conditional structures and loops through CBA macros and ACE3 function headers were added to help you with this.

### Build Project Tools

*Only available if the project being worked on is based on a project framework like CBA's and ACE3's. The project must contain `build.py` and `make.py` tools.*

To ease development when working on projects with a framework like CBA's or ACE3's, quick options for building the project directly from Atom is supported. You have the ability to build a development version or a full release, simply open the Command Palette and search for it or navigate to `Packages -> Language Arma Atom -> Build Dev/Release`.
